# lexical-dementia-detection

## overview 

this repo contains an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing speech data in a cognitive research context. it transforms raw audio recordings into transcripts, extracts structured lexical features, merges them with cognitive assessment scores, and trains a neural network classifier to distinguish between subject groups.

the project combines speech processing, data engineering, and machine learning into a reproducible research workflow.

if you want to expand / my future goals:
- automated lexical feature extraction from transcripts
- multi-class cognitive modeling
- (easy) visualization dashboard
